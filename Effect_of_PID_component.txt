The parameter P is for reducing CTE, but the car is oscillating.
The parameter D is for reducing the quick change of CTE.
The parameter I is for reducing the steady state error of CTE.

I choose the each parameter by manual tuning.

D parameter is set to relatively large value for smooth driving.
P and I parameters are set to relatively small value.
If P and I parameters are large value, the car is oscillating.
